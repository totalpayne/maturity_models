## Level 0 : Unaware 
* Business and IT do not know that information is a problem, while users mistrust the data.

## Level 1 : Aware 
* Some awareness of the importance of Information Strategy and Data Governance.
* Organisation understands the need for common standards, tools and models.
* Minimal investment in people, process and technology; lack of business sponsorship and involvement.
* Effort to document risk associated with uncontrolled information assets has begun.
* Awareness is growing of poor data quality and of fragmented and inconsistent information in key subject areas.

## Level 2 : Reactive 
* Emerging Information Management (IM) Strategy & Roadmap, Governance and Processes.
* Organisation takes steps toward cross-department sharing to achieve operational efficiency.
* Investments are being made to uplift IM capabilities in some areas.
* Risks of not managing information as corporate asset are well understood.

* Consistent and mature governance, policies, procedures and EIM operating model ensures coordination of all IM activities.
* Best practices are identified, and EIM team ensures that these are extended across the enterprise.
